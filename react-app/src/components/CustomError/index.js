            <p>Hey, so I understand that you're disappointed in me. I would be, too, except that I'm not here to experience this with you. As far as I know, this has never happened, and nobody has ever hit this page. Or ever will. Unless you contact me, I will never know that this page doesn't work, and I'll walk around smugly, self-assured I can build working websites.</p>
            <p>But if you reach out to me, how would I know you're telling the truth? Why would I believe you?</p>
            <p>Screencap? Ha! Photoshop, I'll say.</p>
            <p>No, I would only believe a mentor. After all, only a mentor would be trusted to guide me and point out my faults with constructive intent.</p>
            <p>The only logical way to communicate this issue to me is to hire and train me.</p>
            <p>... over this bad code.</p>
